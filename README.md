**Dungeon Mania**

My team of 4 over one months were able to create a dungeon game which included over 30 different entities to replicate a simple dungeon crawl game. This was honestly a super interesting project which focused heavily on code design due to the size of the game. I also gained experience in connecting a backend to the frontend, as well as connecting the object oriented code to the gaming sprites.
